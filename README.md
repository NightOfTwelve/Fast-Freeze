## Fast Freeze, the smart way to close apps

### Intro
Fast Freeze is a jailbreak extension for iOS that allows the user to close apps much smarter with directly suspending them in memory.

Just install the tweak. There will be a section in the settings app to configure the activator action and stuff.

### How do I get?
Compile it for yourself, use the .deb included or buy it in the Cydia Store for just one dollar.

### How do I compile?
You should know that. :P

### License?
Pretty much the BSD license, just don't repackage it and call it your own please!
